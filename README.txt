Rakhi Surprise Webpage (Achu & Nani)
-----------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/script.js
- images/photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg (placeholders)

How to use:
1. Download and unzip the folder.
2. Replace the files images/photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg with your own photos.
   Make sure to keep the same file names (photo1.jpg, photo2.jpg, photo3.jpg).
3. Open index.html in a browser to preview.
4. To share online, you can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting.
   (If you want, I can give short steps to host on GitHub Pages.)

Quick tips:
- If you want cropped faces from group photos, crop them on your phone or use any simple editor, then save with the same filenames.
- To edit text (names or message), open index.html in a text editor and change the content near the top.
- If you'd like me to customize colors or fonts, tell me what you'd prefer and I can update the package.
